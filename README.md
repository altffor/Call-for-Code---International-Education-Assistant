## Short description

### What's the problem?

Over a million students have travelled from across the world to come to the United States to seek the best higher education possible. Every year, thousands of more students begin their journey to the U.S. to pursue their degrees. With the threat of COVID-19 and its impact on in-person communications, an increasing number of international students will need to rely on the internet to find the information that they need.

### How can technology help?

Online interactions are safe from the spreasd of COVID-19. Chatbots are able to provide more detailed and direct information to prospective students in real time.

### The idea

The International Education Assistant, developed from IBM Watson Assistant, provides international students the convenience and simplicity of a chatbot that answers the needs of students that are in the process of applying to postsecondary education in the United States through a conversational format.
